# Instructions

- Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications, and create a new application on the account you want the badge on.
- Go to the bot tab and generate a bot account for the application.
- Click the "Reset Token" button to generate a token (if you have 2fa enabled, you'll need your code).
- Copy the token to your clipboard.
- Click this badge to clone this repo to a new repl in Replit -> https://replit.com/new/github/Gunthersuper/discord-active-developer-badge
  - You will be redirected to Replit, you might have to create an account (you can Register with Google).
    - Replit is a website, and does not run off your computer! 
- Wait for the repo has finished cloning and the repl to fully connect.
- Add your token to Secrets (key - token)
- Click the green "Run" button at the top.
- Wait for it to print 'DONE | Application/Bot is up and running. 
- Create a new discord server (you can delete it at the end).
- Enable community on the server (you only need to do this if you don't own any other discord server with community enabled)
- Return back to https://discord.com/developers/applications.
- Go to OAuth2 and make invite links. It needs only Send text and Read message history permissions.
- In the server, go to a channel and use the ``/ping`` command on the bot.
- Go to the <https://discord.com/developers/active-developer> page and register everything (**if it says you're not eligible, it's because you're not registered in their system yet. you might have to wait up to 48 hours**).
- Congrats on that shiny new badge.

- You have to /ping your bot every 30 days.

**NOTE:** Make sure you have the “Use data to improve Discord” setting enabled under User Settings > Privacy & Safety otherwise you won't be able to be marked as eligible.

**NOTE 2:** You do not need to keep the Replit tab open 24/7. Only go to the Replit url whenever you want to run your bot.
